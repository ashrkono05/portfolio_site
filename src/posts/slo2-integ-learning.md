My article is about the Litter Robot 4. [Read Article Here](https://people.com/whisker-litter-robot-4-review-sale-september-2024-8707771). The article talks about how using the Litter Robot 4 was beneficial for both her and her cat. She was initially worried her cat wouldn't like to use, which is shared amongst many cat owners, due to her cat being easily starled. Her cat was curious enough to try it out though and the cat adopted to the self cleaning litter box within a week.

The company made this for cats and as such they need to have not only the robotic engineers and programmers to make the robot work and the developers to make the app that the litter robot uses to give the owner all the information about the current status of the litter box (when its running low, when the waste box needs to be emptied, the weight of it, etc), but they also would've needed to work with cat experts to ensure most cats would like using the litter robot.

Furthermore, when setting up the device they include instructions on how to acclimate your cat to the litter box to try to make the cat's experience as good as they can make it. In order to get those detailed instructions, they would've needed to do a lot of testing as well as consult with cat behaviorists.

They would also probably get feedback from customers on how they used their previous iteraions of the litter robot and how to better design it for their cat. So the engineers would likely also work with the customer support/feedback team to help design better products in the future. The software development team would also need to work with the customer feedback team to help better design their apps to be easier and simpler and better for the humans to use and to give them more features. They wuld need to work with marketing and business leadership teams to direct resources and create advertisments as as a safety team and a legal to ensure complience with safety regulations and legality of it.
